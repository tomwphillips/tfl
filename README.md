A side-project using [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) to collect data from the Transport for London API at regular intervals and store it in [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/).

The Cloud Functions depend on my package [`request`](https://github.com/tomwphillips/request).
